                The Earth’s natural resources include air, water, soil,
                minerals, fuels, plants, and animals. Conservation is the
                practice of caring for these resources so all living things can
                benefit from them now and in the future. All the things we need
                to survive, such as food, water, air, and shelter, come from
                natural resources. Some of these resources, like small plants,
                can be replaced quickly after they are used. Others, like large
                trees, take a long time to replace. These are renewable
                resources. Other resources, such as fossil fuels, cannot be
                replaced at all. Once they are used up, they are gone forever.
                These are nonrenewable resources. People often waste natural
                resources. Animals are overhunted. Forests are cleared, exposing
                land to wind and water damage. Fertile soil is exhausted and
                lost to erosion because of poor farming practices. Fuel supplies
                are depleted. Water and air are polluted. If resources are
                carelessly managed, many will be used up. If used wisely and
                efficiently, however, renewable resources will last much longer.
                Through conservation, people can reduce waste and manage natural
                resources wisely. The population of human beings has grown
                enormously in the past two centuries. Billions of people use up
                resources quickly as they eat food, build houses, produce goods,
                and burn fuel for transportation and electricity. The
                continuation of life as we know it depends on the careful use of
                natural resources. The need to conserve resources often
                conflicts with other needs. For some people, a wooded area may
                be a good place to put a farm. A timber company may want to
                harvest the area’s trees for construction materials. A business
                may want to build a factory or shopping mall on the land. All
                these needs are valid, but sometimes the plants and animals that
                live in the area are forgotten. The benefits of development need
                to be weighed against the harm to animals that may be forced to
                find new habitats, the depletion of resources we may want in the
                future (such as water or timber), or damage to resources we use
                today. Development and conservation can coexist in harmony. When
                we use the environment in ways that ensure we have resources for
                the future, it is called sustainable development. There are many
                different resources we need to conserve in order to live
                sustainably. Forests A forest is a large area covered with trees
                grouped so their foliage shades the ground. Every continent
                except Antarctica has forests, from the evergreen-filled boreal
                forests of the north to mangrove forests in tropical wetlands.
                Forests are home to more than two-thirds of all known land
                species. Tropical rain forests are especially rich in
                biodiversity. Forests provide habitats for animals and plants.
                They store carbon, helping reduce global warming. They protect
                soil by reducing runoff. They add nutrients to the soil through
                leaf litter. They provide people with lumber and firewood.
                Deforestation is the process of clearing away forests by cutting
                them down or burning them. People clear forests to use the wood,
                or to make way for farming or development. Each year, the Earth
                loses about 14.6 million hectares (36 million acres) of forest
                to deforestation—an area about the size of the U.S. state of New
                York. Deforestation destroys wildlife habitats and increases
                soil erosion. It also releases greenhouse gases into the
                atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Deforestation
                accounts for 15 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
                Deforestation also harms the people who rely on forests for
                their survival, hunting and gathering, harvesting forest
                products, or using the timber for firewood. About half of all
                the forests on Earth are in the tropics—an area that circles the
                globe near the Equator. Although tropical forests cover fewer
                than 6 percent of the world’s land area, they are home to about
                80 percent of the world’s documented species. For example, more
                than 500 different species of trees live in the forests on the
                small island of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea. Tropical
                forests give us many valuable products, including woods like
                mahogany and teak, rubber, fruits, nuts, and flowers. Many of
                the medicines we use today come from plants found only in
                tropical rain forests. These include quinine, a malaria drug;
                curare, an anesthetic used in surgery; and rosy periwinkle,
                which is used to treat certain types of cancer. Sustainable
                forestry practices are critical for ensuring we have these
                resources well into the future. One of these practices is
                leaving some trees to die and decay naturally in the forest.
                This “deadwood” builds up soil. Other sustainable forestry
                methods include using low-impact logging practices, harvesting
                with natural regeneration in mind, and avoiding certain logging
                techniques, such as removing all the high-value trees or all the
                largest trees from a forest. Trees can also be conserved if
                consumers recycle. People in China and Mexico, for example,
                reuse much of their wastepaper, including writing paper,
                wrapping paper, and cardboard. If half the world’s paper were
                recycled, much of the worldwide demand for new paper would be
                fulfilled, saving many of the Earth’s trees. We can also replace
                some wood products with alternatives like bamboo, which is
                actually a type of grass. Soil Soil is vital to food production.
                We need high-quality soil to grow the crops that we eat and feed
                to livestock. Soil is also important to plants that grow in the
                wild. Many other types of conservation efforts, such as plant
                conservation and animal conservation, depend on soil
                conservation. Poor farming methods, such as repeatedly planting
                the same crop in the same place, called monoculture, deplete
                nutrients in the soil. Soil erosion by water and wind increases
                when farmers plow up and down hills. One soil conservation
                method is called contour strip cropping. Several crops, such as
                corn, wheat, and clover, are planted in alternating strips
                across a slope or across the path of the prevailing wind.
                Different crops, with different root systems and leaves, help
                slow erosion. Harvesting all the trees from a large area, a
                practice called clearcutting, increases the chances of losing
                productive topsoil to wind and water erosion. Selective
                harvesting—the practice of removing individual trees or small
                groups of trees—leaves other trees standing to anchor the soil.
                Biodiversity Biodiversity is the variety of living things that
                populate the Earth. The products and benefits we get from nature
                rely on biodiversity. We need a rich mixture of living things to
                provide foods, building materials, and medicines, as well as to
                maintain a clean and healthy landscape. When a species becomes
                extinct, it is lost to the world forever. Scientists estimate
                that the current rate of extinction is 1,000 times the natural
                rate. Through hunting, pollution, habitat destruction, and
                contribution to global warming, people are speeding up the loss
                of biodiversity at an alarming rate. It’s hard to know how many
                species are going extinct because the total number of species is
                unknown. Scientists discover thousands of new species every
                year. For example, after looking at just 19 trees in Panama,
                scientists found 1,200 different species of beetles—80 percent
                of them unknown to science at the time. Based on various
                estimates of the number of species on Earth, we could be losing
                anywhere from 200 to 100,000 species each year. We need to
                protect biodiversity to ensure we have plentiful and varied food
                sources. This is true even if we don’t eat a species threatened
                with extinction because something we do eat may depend on that
                species for survival. Some predators are useful for keeping the
                populations of other animals at manageable levels. The
                extinction of a major predator might mean there are more
                herbivores looking for food in people’s gardens and farms.
                Biodiversity is important for more than just food. For instance,
                we use between 50,000 to 70,000 plant species for medicines
                worldwide. The Great Barrier Reef, a coral reef off the coast of
                northeastern Australia, contributes about $6 billion to the
                nation’s economy through commercial fishing, tourism, and other
                recreational activities. If the coral reef dies, many of the
                fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and plants will die, too. Some
                governments have established parks and preserves to protect
                wildlife and their habitats. They are also working to abolish
                hunting and fishing practices that may cause the extinction of
                some species. Fossil Fuels Fossil fuels are fuels produced from
                the remains of ancient plants and animals. They include coal,
                petroleum (oil), and natural gas. People rely on fossil fuels to
                power vehicles like cars and airplanes, to produce electricity,
                and to cook and provide heat. In addition, many of the products
                we use today are made from petroleum. These include plastics,
                synthetic rubber, fabrics like nylon, medicines, cosmetics,
                waxes, cleaning products, medical devices, and even bubblegum.
                Fossil fuels formed over millions of years. Once we use them up,
                we cannot replace them. Fossil fuels are a nonrenewable
                resource. We need to conserve fossil fuels so we don’t run out.
                However, there are other good reasons to limit our fossil fuel
                use. These fuels pollute the air when they are burned. Burning
                fossil fuels also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,
                contributing to global warming. Global warming is changing
                ecosystems. The oceans are becoming warmer and more acidic,
                which threatens sea life. Sea levels are rising, posing risks to
                coastal communities. Many areas are experiencing more droughts,
                while others suffer from flooding. Scientists are exploring
                alternatives to fossil fuels. They are trying to produce
                renewable biofuels to power cars and trucks. They are looking to
                produce electricity using the sun, wind, water, and geothermal
                energy—the Earth’s natural heat. Everyone can help conserve
                fossil fuels by using them carefully. Turn off lights and other
                electronics when you are not using them. Purchase
                energy-efficient appliances and weatherproof your home. Walk,
                ride a bike, carpool, and use public transportation whenever
                possible. Minerals Earth’s supply of raw mineral resources is in
                danger. Many mineral deposits that have been located and mapped
                have been depleted. As the ores for minerals like aluminum and
                iron become harder to find and extract, their prices skyrocket.
                This makes tools and machinery more expensive to purchase and
                operate. Many mining methods, such as mountaintop removal mining
                (MTR), devastate the environment. They destroy soil, plants, and
                animal habitats. Many mining methods also pollute water and air,
                as toxic chemicals leak into the surrounding ecosystem.
                Conservation efforts in areas like Chile and the Appalachian
                Mountains in the eastern United States often promote more
                sustainable mining methods. Less wasteful mining methods and the
                recycling of materials will help conserve mineral resources. In
                Japan, for example, car manufacturers recycle many raw materials
                used in making automobiles. In the United States, nearly
                one-third of the iron produced comes from recycled automobiles.
                Electronic devices present a big problem for conservation
                because technology changes so quickly. For example, consumers
                typically replace their cell phones every 18 months. Computers,
                televisions, and mp3 players are other products contributing to
                “e-waste.” The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
                estimates that Americans generated more than 3 million tons of
                e-waste in 2007. Electronic products contain minerals as well as
                petroleum-based plastics. Many of them also contain hazardous
                materials that can leach out of landfills into the soil and
                water supply. Many governments are passing laws requiring
                manufacturers to recycle used electronics. Recycling not only
                keeps materials out of landfills, but it also reduces the energy
                used to produce new products. For instance, recycling aluminum
                saves 90 percent of the energy that would be required to mine
                new aluminum. Water Water is a renewable resource. We will not
                run out of water the way we might run out of fossil fuels. The
                amount of water on Earth always remains the same. However, most
                of the planet’s water is unavailable for human use. While more
                than 70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, only
                2.5 percent of it is freshwater. Out of that freshwater, almost
                70 percent is permanently frozen in the ice caps covering
                Antarctica and Greenland. Only about 1 percent of the freshwater
                on Earth is available for people to use for drinking, bathing,
                and irrigating crops. People in many regions of the world suffer
                water shortages. These are caused by depletion of underground
                water sources known as aquifers, a lack of rainfall due to
                drought, or pollution of water supplies. The World Health
                Organization (WHO) estimates that 2.6 billion people lack
                adequate water sanitation. More than 5 million people die each
                year from diseases caused by using polluted water for drinking,
                cooking, or washing. About one-third of Earth’s population lives
                in areas that are experiencing water stress. Most of these areas
                are in developing countries. Polluted water hurts the
                environment as well as people. For instance, agricultural
                runoff—the water that runs off of farmland—can contain
                fertilizers and pesticides. When this water gets into streams,
                rivers, and oceans, it can harm the organisms that live in or
                drink from those water sources. People can conserve and protect
                water supplies in many ways. Individuals can limit water use by
                fixing leaky faucets, taking shorter showers, planting
                drought-resistant plants, and buying low-water-use appliances.
                Governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations can help
                developing countries build sanitation facilities. Farmers can
                change some of their practices to reduce polluted runoff. This
                includes limiting overgrazing, avoiding over-irrigation, and
                using alternatives to chemical pesticides whenever possible.
                Conservation Groups Businesses, international organizations, and
                some governments are involved in conservation efforts. The
                United Nations (UN) encourages the creation of national parks
                around the world. The UN also established World Water Day, an
                event to raise awareness and promote water conservation.
                Governments enact laws defining how land should be used and
                which areas should be set aside as parks and wildlife preserves.
                Governments also enforce laws designed to protect the
                environment from pollution, such as requiring factories to
                install pollution-control devices. Finally, governments often
                provide incentives for conserving resources, using clean
                technologies, and recycling used goods. Many international
                organizations are dedicated to conservation. Members support
                causes such as saving rain forests, protecting threatened
                animals, and cleaning up the air. The International Union for
                the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an alliance of governments
                and private groups founded in 1948. The IUCN works to protect
                wildlife and habitats. In 1980, the group proposed a world
                conservation strategy. Many governments have used the IUCN model
                to develop their own conservation plans. In addition, the IUCN
                monitors the status of endangered wildlife, threatened national
                parks and preserves, and other environments around the world.
                Zoos and botanical gardens also work to protect wildlife. Many
                zoos raise and breed endangered animals to increase their
                populations. They conduct research and help educate the public
                about endangered species. For instance, the San Diego Zoo in the
                U.S. state of California runs a variety of research programs on
                topics ranging from disease control in amphibians to
                heart-healthy diets for gorillas. Scientists at the Royal
                Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London, England, work to protect plant
                life around the world. Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank, for example,
                works with partners in 54 countries to protect biodiversity
                through seed collection. Kew researchers are also exploring how
                DNA technology can help restore damaged habitats.
